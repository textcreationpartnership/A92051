         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Royal PILGRIMAGE Or The PROGRESSE OF King Charles the II.</head>
            <p>AFter the laſt Campagna in <hi>England</hi> at <hi>Naſeby</hi> Field, and the Defeat of my Lord <hi>Goring</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after at <hi>Lamport,</hi> to which ſucceeded the Disbanding of my Lord <hi>Hoptons</hi> Army in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> to whom the King had committed the Care of the Prince in that exigence and diſtreſſe of Affairs; It was directed by his late Majeſty of bleſſed Memory, that the ſaid Prince ſhould be tranſported into the Iſland of <hi>Scilly;</hi> accordingly he imbarqued himſelf with my Lord <hi>Hopton,</hi> and ſome of his principal Servants and other Gentlemen at St. <hi>Michaels-Mount,</hi> and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived ſafely at that Iſland, where he was to attend his Fathers Orders in reference to his own Perſon, and the concerns of the Kingdoms.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:168837:3"/>
            <p>While he was there, he took order for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that Iſle, and placed therein Sir <hi>John Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill</hi> the Son of Sir <hi>Bevill,</hi> to command in chief in his Majeſties name, who upon conditions in 1650. ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred the ſame to the then called Parliament.</p>
            <p>Upon Aviſoes from <hi>England,</hi> that there was ſome Loyal Endeavours on Foot to reſtore his Father, he Sayled into <hi>France,</hi> and was entertained there by the now French King, but with that coldneſſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſeneſs of reſpect that no way ſuited to his Spirit, or his due greatneſs.</p>
            <p>He had not been long there, but part of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Fleet then commanded by Collonel <hi>Ramsbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough,</hi> returned to their Allegiance, and revolted from the ſervice, whereupon the Prince preſently left the French Court, and put himſelf on board that Fleet in the Admiral called the <hi>Reformation</hi> (which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards loſt about the Iſland <hi>Majorca,</hi> Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aboard her, and himſelf and three others hardly eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caping) and lay ſome while in the <hi>Downes,</hi> till it was agreed that he ſhould land ſome Forces, and attaque <hi>Deal</hi> and <hi>Sandwich</hi> Caſtles, which accordingly he maſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, with as much bravery and Gallantry of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as ever they yet manifeſted.</p>
            <p>But notice of his formidable arrival being brought to <hi>London,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> was forthwith ordered to equip all the ſhipping could preſently be made ready to oppoſe him; at his appearance it was thought fit for the Kings Fleet to ſayl for <hi>Holland,</hi> and accordingly they anchored in <hi>Goree,</hi> where the Parliament Ships at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended them, and required of the States of <hi>Holland</hi> either to have them delivered, or put to Sea to fight, judging that the Marriners for want of pay had deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their reſpective ſhips; but the <hi>Hogens</hi> durſt not then venture upon ſuch an action, while the Kings inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt ſeemed yet to be promiſing.</p>
            <p>The Prince then went to the <hi>Hague</hi> to his Brother the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> where indeed he was civilly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:168837:3"/>and magnificently treated, with all the demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of kindneſſe imaginable, which continued during that Princes life, and his ſojournment in that Country. From thence he writ that Letter to his Father which is printed at the end of the Kings book. Hither came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him my Lord <hi>Loughborough,</hi> Collonel <hi>Maſſey &amp;c.</hi> preſently after the Kings death, about which time <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſlaus</hi> was killed there by one Major <hi>Whitford</hi> a Scotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and his aſſociates.</p>
            <p>Immediately after came unto him the Commiſsio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners from the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> tendring unto him their Fealty with ſeveral propoſitions, whereupon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued a Treaty which was the next year concluded on at <hi>Breda,</hi> a Town belonging to the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and the King by the name of <hi>Charls</hi> the ſecond, ſolemnly owned there by them; during which Treaty, my Lord the Marqueſſe of <hi>Montroſe</hi> was defeated in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and barbarouſly executed, to the diſhonour of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of <hi>Argyle</hi> eſpecially.</p>
            <p>He departed about <hi>June</hi> 1649. out of <hi>Holland</hi> by <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> where he was nobly entertayned to the French Court again, where he ſtaid not long, being wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Cardinal <hi>Mazarines</hi> neglects, but took ſhipping for the Iſle of <hi>Jerſey,</hi> where for a while he reſided in <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths</hi> Caſtle, the Governour whereof was Sir <hi>George Cartret,</hi> where the Commiſſioners from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Scotland</hi> made their addreſſes to him, and deſired that he would be pleaſed to repair to <hi>Breda</hi> in order to perfect the Treaty. By the way, we may not forget that gracious deliverance God gave him in his paſſage back again from thence, the Veſſel where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was, being with a ſuddain guſt of wind almoſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſet, had not one accidentally ſtanding by the Sails, cut the ropes that held them.</p>
            <p>At his arrival in <hi>Holland,</hi> I may not omit one paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. Before his departure from thence, came unto him an Envoy or Meſſenger from the French King, his Errand I do not very well remember, but it was ſome inſignificant complement, and preſſed hard for Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:168837:4"/>at laſt my Lord Chancellor <hi>Hide</hi> procured it, and when he had told his Story, he expected the King would have made him an anſwer, but the King diſmiſſed him without a word; at his next Audience, he was very urgent for an anſwer, but no other than before, while the <hi>Monſieur</hi> was overheard to ſay, that the King he knew well enough could ſpeak French, to which his Majeſty was pleaſed to reply, that once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he could ſpeak French, but had lately ſtudied to forget it all, intimating the diſreſpects he had had from that Court. So much by the by.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Breda</hi> he went to <hi>Schiveling</hi> near the <hi>Hague,</hi> where he took ſhipping for <hi>Scotland,</hi> Old <hi>Martin Van Trump</hi> ſetting him on board, and commending the care and preſervation of his perſon to his Son young <hi>Trump,</hi> who commanded the Fleet that tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported him, which conſiſted of four Sail of <hi>Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> Men of War, the King himſelf being in a light Sayling Frigot of thirty ſix Guns. He landed in the North of <hi>Scotland</hi> after a dangerous voyage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caſt upon the Coaſt of <hi>Norway,</hi> and miſt the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> Fleet that lay to attend his landing very narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they having Sayled from thence but five hours before.</p>
            <p>Preſently after his arrival in <hi>Scotland,</hi> he was Crowned on the firſt of <hi>January</hi> 1650. at <hi>Scoon,</hi> Mr. <hi>Robert Douglaſſe</hi> preaching his Coronation Sermon, his Affairs there are ſo well known to every body, that it is needleſſe to recite them here.</p>
            <p>Neither is it more to our purpoſe to mention his expedition to <hi>Worceſter,</hi> his valour and great mind ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in the Action at that place, let us rather buſie our thoughts with the admirable goodneſs of God in his wonderful eſcape from the clutches of the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting RUMP, and that Rebel <hi>Oliver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which way ſoever he eſcaped by the conduct of Mrs. <hi>Lane,</hi> (the general received opinion) he arriv'd about
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:168837:4"/>the end of <hi>October,</hi> 1651. at <hi>Diep</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and ſo on to <hi>Roan;</hi> upon the newes of his arrival at <hi>Paris,</hi> all the great ones of that Court (the late Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> himſelf in perſon) went out to meet him, and congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate his ſafe return. But this fair weather laſted but a while, and the King wiſely removed himſelf from his <hi>French</hi> unhoſpitable harbour, but before he went, he did as good as eſtabliſh the Crown of <hi>France</hi> upon his Couſins head, by bringing the Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> to a neutrality, when the Prince of <hi>Condee</hi> and the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Army had advanced beyond <hi>Paris;</hi> but I think he was never yet thankt for it.</p>
            <p>His next ſtage was the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> to his Siſter of <hi>Orange,</hi> for the Prince her husband was deceaſed, where he reſided till the Peace made betwixt thoſe States and <hi>Oliver,</hi> by which he was (as it were) baniſhed their Dominions, as by the like compact with <hi>Mazarine,</hi> he was the <hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He retired thence to <hi>Colen</hi> a City of <hi>Germany,</hi> upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> to be near at hand his concernments, which were to be taken into conſideration at the <hi>Diet</hi> at <hi>Franckfort</hi> upon the election of the new Emperour, whither he went privately, and walkt the ſtreets <hi>incog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nito,</hi> before the meeting of the States of the Empire, and Forein Embaſſadours.</p>
            <p>He ſojourned alſo a while with the Duke of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> a Prince to whom the King is highly engaged for his manifold high obligements received from him during his abode there, <hi>Mannings</hi> Treaſon was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, who kept correſpondence with <hi>Thurloe, Nolls</hi> Secretary, and betrayed the deſign of Mr. <hi>Penruddock</hi> in the Weſt.</p>
            <p>I may not omit that at <hi>Colen</hi> that Rogue <hi>Hannam</hi> with his complices, robb'd him of all the Plate he had, which the Burgers found out, and returned him again.</p>
            <p>From thence he betook himſelf to the Court at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> being thither invited by the King of <hi>Spain,</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:168837:5"/>who was then newly entred into a war with <hi>Oliver,</hi> and had by him a Court aſſigned for him at <hi>Bruges</hi> in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> with a Princely maintenance to uphold it, where he remained ſome three yeares, till the late enterview of the Favourites upon the Frontire, where he was in private preſent, and from thence paſt on to <hi>Madrid</hi> the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> and was there magnificently treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by that King.</p>
            <p>Thence poſted he back again to St. <hi>Jean de Luz,</hi> where that impudent fellow <hi>Lockhart</hi> made oath he ſaw him at Maſſe, but had the reward of a <hi>Scot,</hi> not to be believed. In his return from thence through <hi>France,</hi> he was careſſed all the way by the great ones of that Kingdome, and adored as a riſing ſun, and at laſt ſafely and happily returned to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> where he now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, waiting the good hour of our returning to our obedience.</p>
            <p>Now what obſtinate perverſe diſobedience can ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject any thing againſt this our rightful Soveraign, whom ſo great experience, the knowledge of all places, men, and manners, acquired by his own view, have ſo fitted and accompliſhed to Reign and Rule well, it having been the only ſtudy in his Exile: God hath made him the better, and we the worſe by his abſence.</p>
